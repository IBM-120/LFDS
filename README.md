# LFDS

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
There is a need for long range, low cost early fire detection and alert system to reduce the severity of wildfires caused either by human activities such as the burning of debris or natural phenomena like lightning.
 Survey says that in the last year 68000 to 72000 wildfires are reported and around 8.1 to 8.3million acres burned.

SOLUTION:
Our solution is a LoRa based fire detection and alert system that provides the information about the location of onset of fire to the nearest ground station, thus reducing the severity of the wildfire that leads to the destruction of natural habitat of flora and fauna. Our system is a low cost , long range early fire detection and alert system that uses protocol in the ISM band to transfer information and uses convolutional neural networks for the classification and prediction of wildfires.
